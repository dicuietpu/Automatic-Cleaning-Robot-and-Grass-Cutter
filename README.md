# AUTOMATIC CLEANING ROBOT AND GRASS CUTTER:
The project aims at fabricating a robot which can be used for both cleaning homes and maintenance of lawns economically. Purpose of this project is to reduce the cost of labor induced. It also aims at reducing the human efforts with increase in efficiency and preciseness. 

## Getting started:
Arduino boards are easily available in the market and the software used for it is Arduino IDE that can be download from https://www.arduino.cc/ .

### Prerequisites:
1. A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. An Arduino-compatible microcontroller.
3. A USB A-to-B cable, or another appropriate way to connect your Arduino-compatible microcontroller to your computer.

### Installing:
1. Go to the Arduino https://www.arduino.cc/ . and download the latest version of the Arduino software for Windows.
2. When the download is finished, unzip it and open up the Arduino folder to confirm that yes, there are indeed some files and subfolders inside. The file structure is important so don’t be moving any files around unless you really know what you’re doing.
3. Power up your Arduino by connecting your Arduino board to your computer with a USB cable (or FTDI connector if you’re using an Arduino pro). You should see the an LED lobed ‘ON’ light up
4. If you’re running Windows 8,8.1,10 you’ll need to disable driver signing.
5. For running a basic program on the board.
	a.	Launch the Arduino application
	b.	If you disconnected your board, plug it back in
	c.	 Open the Blink example sketch by going to: File > Examples > 1. Basics > Blink
	d.	 Select the type of Arduino board you’re using: Tools > Board > your board type
	e.	 Select the serial/COM port that your Arduino is attached to: Tools > Port > COMxx
	f.	If you’re not sure which serial device is your Arduino, take a look at the available ports, then unplug your Arduino and look again. The one that disappeared is your Arduino.
	g.	 With your Arduino board connected, and the Blink sketch open, press the ‘Upload’ button
	h.	 After a second, you should see some LEDs flashing on your Arduino, followed by the message ‘Done Uploading’ in the status bar of the Blink sketch.
	i.	If everything worked, the onboard LED on your Arduino should now be blinking.

### Running the tests:
Two different codes for two different modules. Copy these codes directly to the Arduino IDE and run it directly on the board.
Module-1(REMOTE)
Module-2(ROBOT)
